# Factory Manager Project
The original creators are Aashish Agrawal, Karan Ahuja, Richard Miramontes, and Zohar Sajith (group 2) from the class: Software Engineering I of Fall 2019.\
\
The purpose of the project was to implement the Scrum methodology as best as we could in a classroom setting.\
\
This project was done over the course of three releases. The first two composed of four 1-week sprints. The third had three 1-week sprints, and it was focused on testing and inspection of the game.\
\
Before every release, we populated the sprint backlog in Jira, a proprietary issue tracking product that allows Agile project management. The team met before each sprint to plan the upcoming sprint and determine how long the user stories would take. Then, the team picked which tasks to do individually, and/or I assigned them certain tasks.
